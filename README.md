# üå± Calyx


### Overview

Calyx is an open source application that aids home gardeners in planning crop rotations. Uses geographical and crop information to help home gardeners while also promoting natural healthy soil management.


### Problem Statement

Calyx is a gardening application that is designed to promote the planting of local crops. The planting of non native crops can have a negative impact on the local ecosystems. This application will help home gardeners to plan their crops in a way that is beneficial to the local environment.


### Key Features

  - Crop recommendation system
		  A database with crop requirements the app will use the data of recommended planting time, germination time, and regionality to pick the best crops.
		    Recommends a companion plant that will help with soil health
			
	- Pest warning system
		  Regional pest information from federal agencies along with along with	regional location information will determine the best time to plant and the	pest to look out for.
		
	- Soil health information‚ÇÅ
		  A bar chart that has the estimated pH Level, Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K),	and Nitrogen (N).
			  Logging soil additives and minerals estimate soil health over time.
			
	- UI Garden planner
		  The garden sizing addition gives proper crop spacing, helps them to map out	their space efficiently, and know the proper amount of seeds needed.
		
	- Gantt chart that has the planned crop rotation.
		  This will display the planned crops for the next four seasons.
		
	- Document sheet that can come in the form of a PNG, PDF, or CSV.
