	- Pest warning system
		  Regional pest information from federal agencies along with along with	regional location information will determine the best time to plant and the	pest to look out for.
		
	- Soil health information₁
		  A bar chart that has the estimated pH Level, Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K),	and Nitrogen (N).
			  Logging soil additives and minerals estimate soil health over time.
			
	- UI Garden planner
		  The garden sizing addition gives proper crop spacing, helps them to map out	their space efficiently, and know the proper amount of seeds needed.
